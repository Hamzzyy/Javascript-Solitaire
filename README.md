## Formatting Rules

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to manage the code styling and formatting.

To use, install Prettier following the instructions [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install).

After adding or updating code changes, open a terminal window at the root folder of your project and run the following command:

`npx prettier . --write`.

Optionally, you can first check which files need formatting with the command `npx prettier . --check`.

The current formatting configuration sets the following guidelines:

-   The _tab_ indentation level is 4 spaces.
-   Double quotes are used as default.
-   There are no semicolons used at the end of statements.
-   Object literals have spaces between brackets.
-   Arrow functions will always include parenthesis around parameters.
